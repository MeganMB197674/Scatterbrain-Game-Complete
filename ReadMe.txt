This project leverages JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3 to create a memory game called 'Scatterbrain' - which requires players
to memorize a given phrase in a set amount of time that is controlled by a countdown. Once the timer is up, players will be presented a form with drop-down menus as a quiz to test their memory. 

Once answers are entered, the user will click a button to get their score - which will display new information telling the player which  quiz questions they scored correct on, which they got wrong, and how many out of the number of questions asked that they got correct.

Events triggered onclick, onmouseout, onmouseover, and others are incortporated into this site for added interaction. This site's Javascript also uses array objects to present information.

Enjoy testing your memory!
